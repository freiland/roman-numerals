Start with making tests to count from 1 to 10.

I = 1
II = 2
III = 3
IV = 4
V = 5
VI = 6
VII = 7
VIII = 8
IX = 9
X = 10

User inputs a number 1-10, number is parsed to integer. 

Specs - Increasing complexity


// if total characters less than or equal to three and characters are equal, add the value of the roman numerals.

// if total characters less than or equal to three and characters not equal : 

---if value of next character is greater than proceeding character subtract the values

---if value of next character is less than the value of proceeding character add the values of the characters.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


//if value of first character is less than the value of the second character subtract the values.
